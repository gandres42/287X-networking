1: Completed TCP sockets without message protocol implemented
- Still teaches about using TCP sockets, but with the instability and steep learning curve
- Must be run on a non-IASTATE network
- Requires heavy workarounds with several buffers for missed packets and keepalives.  Not O(n) thinking.

2: I2C with FeatherS2 targets
- still unsure about feasibility of I2CTarget class
- new implementation
- given simple nature of these targets, may be worth just making seperate C code for it, which could be useful for a number of reasons
- C libraries known to work, jsut having students implement their own sensors

3: I2C temp sensors replace secondary nodes
- Significantly reduces codebase cruft
- Stll teaches about I2C in a more real-world applicable way
- Secondary nodes literally just glorified temp sensors, with no
